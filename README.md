# LangchainChatBot

Requirements:
huggingface_hub
langchain
sentence_transformers
faiss-cpu
FastAPI


How to run the code:
Run main.py to see the chatbot deployed on the website. Command to run Main.py is 'uvicorn main:app --reload'.
Note: Read Practice.ipynb for better understanding of the code. It'll also take time for model to run on large dataset(so please wait).
